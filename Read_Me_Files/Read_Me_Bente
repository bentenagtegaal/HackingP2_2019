Inspect the inspection tool

My inspection tool: big tweezers
I chose this tool because it relates to my major, fashion, for which it is used to inspect fabrics.
By pulling out threads of a fabric with tweezers, you can inspect the material.
In my major, it is also used in machines such as a sewing machine and an overlock machine to pull the thread through.
I assumed that tweezers are most regularly used to pull hair.
By feeling it, and holding it I observed these things:
// cold // heavy // light sound // clicking // picking // pinching // bend
comparable to: pinching finger and thumb // two fingers // legs // arm
motion: pinching // picking up small things // squeezing
According to some of its components, I came up with other purposes.
hole in the center > hang up // push through // necklace // ornament
pinching force > hold something together // push outwards
tip > poking // making a hole
use for eating (instead of chopsticks)
use to make music (clicking)


Inspection tool from classmate: a lighter
purpose mostly used for: lighting cigarettes
purpose used for in my major: burning threads to inspect a material/fibre
halfwarm // light // clicking // pushing // thumb
comparable to: toes, feet
motion: bending thumb to push the button


In a group
inspection tools
1. tweezers
2. lighter
3. book
4. sketchbook

2+4 temporary use, lose value.
1+3 will not use value.

Manuscript

Nobody can escape death, but what if you can?
Bente Nagtegaal 0943130

According to Ray Kurzweil, the life-expectancy from 2025 will raise by 1 year a year. 
That means that nobody will ever die, if you get treated with the newest technologies.
Techniques such as reprogramming of genes, like switching off elderly-genes and fat-genes, will result in us being healthier. 
Miniscule robots will live in our bodies to keep us healthy. This way we won’t die of old age or sickness. 
Some scientists claim that the human body isn’t made to live longer than 150 years.
Ian Person says, that people that are born after 1970 have eternal life, unless you get a terrible disease.
Genetic manipulation is the future for eternal life. Because of this you can be a 90-year old in a 30-year old body.
Another theory is that we use robots to extend our lives. 
Person says that we can link our spirit to the world of machines so well, that we can effectively live in the ‘cloud’. 
He says that this can be reality within 50 years. If you die, your spirit gets saved on a computer, to live further in a robot-body.
And another theory is to live further in a virtual world. 
If our spirit is in a database, we don’t need robots and we can live happily ever after in a computer simulation. 
Online, in the virtual world.



Manifesto

The Sims Expension Pack: Afterlife

Manifesto Hacking

When we die, our spirits get transferred on to a database. 
The spirit will continue to live forever, in a virtual world. 
By purchasing the ‘The Sims Expension pack: Afterlife’ you will be able to transform yourself into a virtual character, or multiple. 
In here, you can build a house, a family, basically everything you could in your past life, and even more. 
You can choose to be male, female, or invent a new kind of gender. 
It is basically a limitless game, where your spirit can live his or her afterlife for the rest of eternity, in happiness and serenity. 
You can live everywhere you want, you can visit family members and friends that have passed, if they also have purchased the game. 
Many costumers say that this virtual world is better than life on earth. No diseases, inconveniences, sadness and most of all: no death. 
It’s like hacking all negative things of the real world and entering real ‘heaven’.



To me the definition of hacking is changing a system.
Amateuristic or professional.
Big impact or a small impact.
It just comes down to changing something.
