Inspect the inspection tool

My inspection tool: big tweezers
I chose this tool because it relates to my major, fashion, for which it is used to inspect fabrics.
By pulling out threads of a fabric with tweezers, you can inspect the material.
In my major, it is also used in machines such as a sewing machine and an overlock machine to pull the thread through.
I assumed that tweezers are most regularly used to pull hair.
By feeling it, and holding it I observed these things:
// cold // heavy // light sound // clicking // picking // pinching // bend
comparable to: pinching finger and thumb // two fingers // legs // arm
motion: pinching // picking up small things // squeezing
According to some of its components, I came up with other purposes.
hole in the center > hang up // push through // necklace // ornament
pinching force > hold something together // push outwards
tip > poking // making a hole
use for eating (instead of chopsticks)
use to make music (clicking)


Inspection tool from classmate: a lighter
purpose mostly used for: lighting cigarettes
purpose used for in my major: burning threads to inspect a material/fibre
halfwarm // light // clicking // pushing // thumb
comparable to: toes, feet
motion: bending thumb to push the button


In a group
inspection tools
1. tweezers
2. lighter
3. book
4. sketchbook

2+4 temporary use, lose value.
1+3 will not use value.

Hacking is not a new thing, it has been going on for many years, under different names.
